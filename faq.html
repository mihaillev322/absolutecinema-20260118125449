                        <h3>What types of video production services do you offer in Canada (corporate, events, weddings, commercials)?</h3>
                        <p>AbsoluteCinema provides comprehensive video production services across Canada including corporate video production for training, promotional, and internal communications; event videography for conferences, product launches, and corporate gatherings; wedding videography with cinematic storytelling; commercial video production for advertising and marketing campaigns; and specialized drone videography for aerial perspectives. Each service includes pre-production planning, professional filming with 4K equipment, and post-production editing with colour grading and sound design.</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>How much does cinematic video production cost in Canada?</h3>
                        <p>Video production costs vary significantly based on project scope, duration, location requirements, crew size, equipment needs, and post-production complexity. Corporate videos typically range from basic single-camera setups to multi-day productions with multiple crew members. Wedding videography packages vary based on coverage hours and deliverables. Commercial productions depend on creative requirements and distribution needs. We provide detailed quotes after understanding your specific project requirements, timeline, and budget parameters to ensure transparent pricing with no hidden fees.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Do you travel for shoots across Canada, and are travel fees different by province?</h3>
                        <p>Yes, we travel throughout Canada for video production projects. Travel fees are calculated based on distance, transportation method, accommodation requirements, and crew size. Projects within major metropolitan areas typically have minimal travel costs, while remote locations or multi-day shoots may require additional travel and accommodation expenses. We provide transparent travel cost estimates during the quoting process and work with clients to optimize logistics and minimize expenses while ensuring crew safety and equipment security across all Canadian provinces and territories.</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>How far in advance should I book a videographer for an event or wedding in Canada?</h3>
                        <p>We recommend booking 2-6 months in advance for optimal availability, especially during peak wedding season (May through October) and busy corporate event periods. Popular dates like summer weekends, holiday seasons, and major conference periods book quickly. Early booking also allows adequate time for pre-production planning, location scouting, and coordination with other vendors. Rush projects can sometimes be accommodated with additional fees, but advance booking ensures better preparation, preferred crew assignment, and more competitive pricing for your video production needs.</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>What is your typical turnaround time for editing and final delivery?</h3>
                        <p>Standard turnaround times vary by project type: corporate videos typically require 2-4 weeks, event highlight reels 1-2 weeks, wedding films 4-8 weeks, and commercial productions 3-6 weeks. Timeline depends on footage volume, editing complexity, colour grading requirements, motion graphics needs, and revision rounds. Rush delivery is available for urgent projects with expedited fees. We provide detailed timelines during project planning and send regular updates throughout post-production. All projects include multiple revision rounds to ensure your complete satisfaction with the final product.</p>

                        <p>Absolutely! We understand the importance of bilingual content for Canadian markets and offer comprehensive bilingual video production services. This includes bilingual scripting, French and English voice-over recording with professional talent, subtitle creation in both official languages, and culturally appropriate adaptations for Quebec and francophone markets. Our team works with certified translators and native French speakers to ensure accurate, natural-sounding content that resonates with both English and French-speaking Canadian audiences while maintaining consistent brand messaging across both language versions.</p>

All drone operations comply with Canadian Aviation Regulations including pilot certification, aircraft registration, flight planning, and airspace authorization. We handle all necessary permits for controlled airspace, maintain comprehensive insurance coverage, and follow strict safety protocols. Drone filming restrictions apply near airports, in national parks, over crowds, and in urban areas.

                        <p>Standard packages include three rounds of revisions to ensure your complete satisfaction. The revision process begins with a rough cut for overall structure and content review, followed by a fine cut incorporating your feedback, and final polish addressing any remaining adjustments. We provide detailed revision guidelines and use collaborative review platforms for efficient feedback collection. Additional revisions beyond the included rounds are available at hourly rates. Major scope changes may require separate quotes. Our goal is to deliver exactly what you envision while maintaining project timelines and budget parameters.</p>
